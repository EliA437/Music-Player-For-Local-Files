# Music-Player-For-Local-Files

Overview
This repository contains the code for a Music Player application built using React and Firebase. The project demonstrates my ability to create an interactive music player that allows users to upload and manage their music library. This repository is intended for demonstration purposes, and users may need to perform additional setup for practical use.

Features
Music Upload Interface: Developed a user interface using React that enables users to easily upload music files to a Firebase database.

Interactive Playback Controls: Designed an interactive UI that allows users to pause, play, skip, and rewind local music files uploaded to the database, utilizing the useState and React Hooks for a seamless experience.

Disclaimer
This repository is primarily intended to showcase my coding skills and the functionality of the music player. Due to potential complexities in setup and configuration, it may not be immediately ready for use without modifications. Users should have a basic understanding of React and Firebase for successful implementation.
